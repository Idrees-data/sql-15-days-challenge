# SQL 15 Day Challenge 🚀

I created this repository to document my **15 day learning journey in SQL** with MySQL.

## Learning Progress
- ✅ Day 1 - SQL Fundamentals (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT)
- ✅ Day 2 - Filtering Records and Selecting Columns (WHERE clause, column aliases)
- ✅ Day 3 - Advanced Filtering Techniques (BETWEEN clause, IN & NOT IN clauses, AND / OR clauses)
- ✅ Day 4 - Using Aggregate Functions, GROUP BY clause, and HAVING clause
- ✅ Day 5 - Use of CASE WHEN statement and Difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses
- ✅ Day 6: INNER JOIN basics (students & courses)
- ✅ Day 7: JOIN with GROUP BY and HAVING
- ✅ Day 8: LEFT JOIN, NULL handling, and Subqueries
- ✅ Day 9: Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)

There will be examples and the queries I wrote for practice each day.

📌 I will be sharing my learning experiences publicly so that I have the motivation to continue learning to become a better SQL user every day.
